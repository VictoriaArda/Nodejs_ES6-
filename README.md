# About
First, you prompt the user for their github username and favorite color. It takes the values and makes a call to Github's API to get the user data such as Bio, number of public repos, followers, following and github stars data. It generates an HTML page using the favorite color as the color scheme and also creates a PDF of the HTML file into the same directory.  

# How it works
    1. Within the working directory, run 'npm install'.
    2. Then run 'node index.js'.
    3. It prompts for your github username.
    4. It prompts for your favorite color using a selection in the terminal.
    5. It then generates the index.html file and converts it to resume.pdf.
